# Joke Junction Web App

The Joke Junction web app is a simple application built using Node.js, EJS, Axios, Express, and Body-parser. It generates jokes based on different categories selected by users.

## Features

- **Joke Categories:** Users can select different joke categories such as puns, programming jokes, Misc jokes, etc.
- **API Integration:** Axios is used to fetch jokes from an external API.
- **Server-Side Rendering:** EJS templating engine is utilized for server-side rendering of dynamic content.
- **Express Framework:** Express.js is used to set up the server and handle routes.
- **Body-parser Middleware:** Body-parser is employed to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/joke-junction.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    cd joke-junction
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define any necessary environment variables (if applicable).

    ```bash
    PORT=3000
    # Add other environment variables here if needed
    ```

4. **Start the Application:**

    Run the following command to start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port in your environment variables).

## Usage

1. Access the web app via your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Select a joke category from the available options.
3. The app will fetch and display a joke based on the selected category.

## Folder Structure

- `views/`: Contains EJS templates for rendering HTML content.
- `public/`: Stores static files (CSS, client-side JavaScript, images, etc.).
- `app.js`: Entry point of the application where the server is set up and configured.
